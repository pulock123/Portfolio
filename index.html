                <h3> Building Climber and Train Stopper </h3>
                <p> You might see me jumping, climbing buildings and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work. Later I heard that Web Development is lucrative and well paid. That's why I am learning and mastering Web Development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero. </p>

                <p> They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero. </p>
